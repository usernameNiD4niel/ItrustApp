# ITrust Application Project

- This project is created exclusive for Barangay Alawihao Daet Camarines Norte, the reason behind this is because the population growth in this barangay is too high than the usual barangay population growth.
- This project aims to control the growth of the population in the said barangay by implementing this application.
- The application has 22 features combined for `Regular Users` and `Admin`.
- Because of this project I received an award being a `Senior Software Developer` and lead our thesis to be the best thesis of the year.
